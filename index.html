                "Sitting on a Memory" is a project led by Moe Ebii that delves into the often-overlooked stories hidden in the plaques of New York’s park benches. Each plaque tells a unique story—some of love, some of loss, and others celebrating a life well lived. Yet, most passersby never pause long enough to listen. Through this project, Moe explores these silent markers of memory, shedding light on the lives of individuals commemorated in this quiet way.

                Her work culminated in the creation of a publication, which includes in-depth articles, investigations into the lives of those honored on plaques, and an A-Z guide to New York City’s bench plaques. During her research, Moe uncovered a troubling aspect of the "Adopt-a-Bench" program—the financial barrier it creates. In Central Park, for example, dedicating a plaque costs $10,000. While these funds help maintain the park, Moe questions whether it’s fair that one must pay such a hefty sum to honor a loved one.

                This concern led her to ask: How can we make bench plaques accessible to all? How can everyone have the right to dedicate a bench without the burden of cost?

                In response, Moe created a digital platform that addresses these issues. By using Arena, a free-to-use service, she allows anyone to dedicate a virtual plaque in a public, digital space. Through this website, users can share messages, images, and tributes to their loved ones, creating a digital "park plaque" that is accessible to all, regardless of financial means. This initiative allows for love, memory, and tribute to be shared freely with the world, without the limitations of price.
